**Platform Monitor**

*	*Test Processor*: Processes all configured tests.

*	*Test Protocol*: Currently implements only HTTP/HTTPS. Configurable.

*	*Configuration Manager*: Manages configuration of tests to be run in an external text configuration. Mid to long term vision is to have configuration done on a GUI.

*	*Test Runner*: Runs the configured tests.
